Maya McCain

I am a third year student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science & Sustainability. I have an interest in freshwater systems, so I am minoring in Watershed Science. I aspire to connect my knowledge in both realms in order to forge a fulfilling career in the natural resources field.

I have experience doing undergraduate research with the Cusack Ecosystem Lab focusing on drought in tropical ecosystems and its effects on root and soil dynamics. During my participation in a watershed science field course, I gained hands-on experience with active restoration projects. Learning about globalization and sustainable development from a study abroad course in Costa Rica provided me with a new perspective on how natural resources are handled around the world.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in outdoor activities such as climbing, skiing, slack-lining, backpacking, and more. I am fond of building my community and listening to live music as well.
