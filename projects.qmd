**ESS 330: Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science**

Mike Johnson, PhD, Jaque McVey, Alan Cai

Spring 2025

Below are a few of my projects based in R from Quantitative Reasoning.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github_image.jpg")
```

## Projects Website

[Lab 1: Personal Portfolio](https://mayamccain.github.io/)

-   Built a static users site with Github Pages.
-   Includes a github repo for access to all the code.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/minnesota_trees.jpg")
```
## Manipulating and Summarizing Data with dplyr

[Lab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth](lab02.html)

-   Explored data manipulation using dplyr using a long term tree growth observation record from Minnesota.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/covid.jpg")
```
## Data Wrangling and Visualization

[Lab 3: COVID-19](lab-03.html)

-   Worked with a large COVID dataset.
-   Practiced data management by creating reports and visualizations.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/LTER.png")
```
## Statistics in R

[Lab 4: LTER Network Data](lab4.html)

-   Conducted basic statistical tests in R such as chi-square, t-tests, and correlation tests.
-   Utilized Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Data to conduct statistical tests and interpret results.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidymodels.png")
```
## Using Tidymodels & CAMELS Data

[Lab 6: Machine Learning in Hydrology](lab-06.html)

-   Utilized tidymodels, a helpful tool for machine learning and statistical modeling in R.
-   Worked with the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies), a large dataset of many characteristics of river basins in the United States.
-   Explored predictive modeling.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/machine_learning.webp")
```
## Machine Learning

[Lab 8: The Whole Game Plan](hyperparameter-tuning.html)

-   Created a machine learning pipeline by putting together knowledge of the full machine learning process.
-   Included feature engineering, resampling, machine learning goals, types of models and R engines, performance evaluation, and final model tuning.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global_map.jpg")
```
## Distances and Projections

[Lab 10: Distance from the Border Zone](lab-10.html)

-   Visualized data on a spatial scale.
-   Injested and built simple feature objects from R packages and CSVs.
-   Manipulated geometries and coordinate systems.
-   Calculated distances and built maps using ggplot.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/poudre.jpg")
```
## Final Project: Snow Water Equivalent and Streamflow

[Lab 5: Quarto Manscripts & Ideation, Lab 7: Introduction, Data, Methods, Lab 9: Results and Discussion](https://mayamccain.github.io/ess-330-lab-07/index.html)

-   Explored tools and functionality of Quarto Manuscripts.
-   Synthesized literature to explore the relationship between snow water equivalent (SWE) and streamflow
-   Worked with SWE and streamflow data to analyze statistical tests, time series analysis, and correlations between variables.
-   Wrote a scientific research-style paper reporting findings and data analysis.
