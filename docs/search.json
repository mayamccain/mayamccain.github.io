    "text": "Maya McCain\nI am a third-year student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science & Sustainability. I have an interest in freshwater systems, so I am minoring in Watershed Science. I aspire to connect my knowledge in both realms in order to forge a fulfilling career in the natural resources field.\nI have experience doing undergraduate research with the Cusack Ecosystem Lab focusing on drought in tropical ecosystems and its effects on root and soil dynamics. During my participation in a watershed science field course, I gained hands-on experience with active restoration projects. Learning about globalization and sustainable development from a study abroad course in Costa Rica provided me with a new perspective on how natural resources are handled around the world.\nIn my free time, I enjoy participating in outdoor activities such as climbing, skiing, slack-lining, backpacking, and more. I am fond of building my community and listening to live music as well."
